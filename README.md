### About me
Hi, I'm @Ayil9158, a computer systems engineering student, so as such I am interested in programming, especially in Python.

Spanish's my first language  but I also have an intermediate understanding of English (if you don't speak either one, don't worry, Google Translate will do the job so we can communicate lol).

I created this account so I can save my work and have a kind of record of how I'm progressing in my career (in terms of programming).

I'm open to collaborating with everyone (as long as time allows, of course).

How to reach me: ayilangulo9158@gmail.com
