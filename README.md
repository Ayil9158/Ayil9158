### About me
Hi, I'm @Ayil9158, a computer systems engineering student, so as such I am interested in programming, especially in the Python language.

My first language is Spanish but I also have an intermediate understanding of English (if you don't speak either one, don't worry, Google Translate will do the job so we can communicate lol).

I created this account so I can save my work and have a kind of record of how I'm progressing in my career (in terms of programming).

I'm open to collaborating with everyone (as long as time allows, of course).
